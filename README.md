In this project, I analyzed data about the App Store and Google Play mobile apps with the goal of recommending an app profile that can be profitable for both markets.

Project workflow:

* Clarifying the goal of our project
* Collecting relevant data
* Cleaning the data to prepare it for analysis
* Analyzing the cleaned data
* Making a recommendation based on the data.
